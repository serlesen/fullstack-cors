# Fullstack CORS

Explanatory video: https://youtu.be/phs90_s0Mjk

Project to show how to solve the CORS problem for a Spring Boot 3 project.

The project is composed by a backend project made with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 6 and a frontend project with React.

The frontend project is just here to show the error.

The backend project uses the configuration in Spring Security to show an alternative to WebMvcConfigurer.
