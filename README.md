# Fullstack CORS

Explanatory video: https://youtu.be/uMJnAxapF7E

Project to show how to solve the CORS problem for a Spring Boot 3 project.

The project is composed by a backend project made with Spring Boot 3 and a frontend project with Angular.

The frontend project is just here to show the error.

The backend project has a static index.html to show that the error doesn't occur when the request is made from the same domain.

Then, the WebConfig should solve the CORS problem for all the endpoints for a given domain.
